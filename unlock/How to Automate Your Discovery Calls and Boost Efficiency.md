Discovery calls are a key tool for business and life coaches, as well as other professionals working one-on-one with clients. These calls help you pitch your offers and close sales. However, managing these calls can be time-consuming without an automated, replicable process. This guide will walk you through how to streamline your discovery calls using automation tools and strategies.

## 1. Build a Landing Page to Highlight Your Offer

Your first step is to create a landing page that showcases your discovery call offer. Use this page to explain what the call includes and why potential clients should book with you. Landing page software like [Leadpages](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) makes this process easy. Leadpages provides customizable, professional templates to build an optimized page that captures leads efficiently—without requiring technical skills.

## 2. Use Scheduling Software with a Questionnaire

Automate the process further by using scheduling software such as Acuity Scheduling. Set it up so leads must fill out a short questionnaire before booking their call. This helps you qualify potential clients and ensures the leads are a good fit for your services. Don’t hesitate to include specific questions that filter out unqualified leads.

## 3. Automate Transactional Emails

Once a potential client books a call and completes the questionnaire, set up your autoresponder to send confirmation emails. These emails should include details about the call, preparation tips, and instructions. Platforms like Leadpages easily integrate with popular email automation tools to streamline this process.

## 4. Allow Clients to Schedule Calls on Their Terms

Give potential clients the flexibility to choose their preferred time for the call. Most scheduling tools allow you to display your availability, making it easy for clients to select a time that works for them. You can even set up different time blocks for various call types, so you’re always prepared.

## 5. Use a Dedicated Business Phone Line

Consider using a dedicated phone line for your discovery calls. Tools like [Leadpages](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) help simplify communication by integrating with other business tools. A dedicated line ensures you’re always prepared when a potential client calls.

---

## 6. Review the Client’s Questionnaire in Advance

Before the scheduled call, review the client’s answers to the questionnaire. This helps you tailor the conversation to their needs and demonstrate how your services can solve their problems. Tools like Zapier can automate document organization, sending the questionnaire responses to Google Drive or another storage platform.

---

## 7. Automate Follow-Up Emails

After the discovery call, send automated follow-up emails with additional information or a tailored offer. Use tools like IFTTT or Zapier to trigger follow-up sequences based on call outcomes. This ensures you maintain contact and increase the likelihood of converting leads into clients.

---

## Bonus Tip: Create Urgency in Your Offers

During your follow-up, provide the client with a deadline to accept your offer. A sense of urgency can motivate clients to take action, helping you avoid overbooking while closing deals faster.
